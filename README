Quickly thrown together, but should be usable enough!
Just save the one page chat log ("show all entries" -> Show on one page) in a folder called "raw",
 then change the name of the file in the getSkills notebook and run it all to get the data out.
Some plotting happens in plotSkills (gasp!), but you should add a dict that mapps player names to char names
as well as a list of player names.
